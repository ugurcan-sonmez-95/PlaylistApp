**PlaylistApp**

We will create a menu driven application that will simulate a user playing songs from a playlist of songs.

We will use a list to simulate the user selecting the first song in the playlist and then selecting 
next and previous to play forward of backwards through the playlist.

We will also allow users to add new song to the playlist and they will be added prior to the currently playing song.

The menu looks as follows:

F - Play first song
N - Play next song
P - Play previous song
A - Add and play a new song at current location
L - List the current playlist

Enter a selection (Q to quit):
